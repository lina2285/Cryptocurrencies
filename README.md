# Cryptocurrencies

## Overview

the purpose of this analys is to help Martha, a senior manager for the Advisory Services Team at Accountability Accounting, offer a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for her customers. Therefore, a report was created to include what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment.

The data Martha will be working with is not ideal, so it will need to be processed to fit the machine learning models. Since there is no known output for what Martha is looking for, she has decided to use unsupervised learning. To group the cryptocurrencies, Martha decided on a clustering algorithm. Sheâ€™ll use data visualizations to share her findings with the board.
